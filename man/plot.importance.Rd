\usage{
\method{plot}{importance}(
  x,
  ...,
  top = 10,
  radar = TRUE,
  text_start_point = 0.5,
  text_size = 3.5,
  xmeasure = "sumCover",
  ymeasure = "sumGain"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a result from the \code{importance} function.}

\item{...}{other parameters.}

\item{top}{number of positions on the plot or NULL for all variable. Default 10.}

\item{radar}{TRUE/FALSE. If TRUE the plot shows
six measures of variables' or interactions' importance in the model.
If FALSE the plot containing two chosen measures
of variables' or interactions' importance in the model.}

\item{text_start_point}{place, where the names of the particular feature start. Available for `radar=TRUE`. Range from 0 to 1. Default 0.5.}

\item{text_size}{size of the text on the plot. Default 3.5.}

\item{xmeasure}{measure on the x-axis.Available for `radar=FALSE`. Default "sumCover".}

\item{ymeasure}{measure on the y-axis. Available for `radar=FALSE`. Default "sumGain".}
}
\value{
a ggplot object
}
\description{
This functions plots selected measures of importance for variables and interactions.
It is possible to visualise importance table in two ways: radar plot with six measures
and scatter plot with two choosen measures.
}
\details{
Available measures:
\itemize{
\item "sumGain" - sum of Gain value in all nodes, in which given variable occurs,
\item "sumCover" - sum of Cover value in all nodes, in which given variable occurs; for LightGBM models: number of observation, which pass through the node,
\item "mean5Gain" - mean gain from 5 occurrences of given variable with the highest gain,
\item "meanGain" - mean Gain value in all nodes, in which given variable occurs,
\item "meanCover" - mean Cover value in all nodes, in which given variable occurs; for LightGBM models: mean number of observation, which pass through the node,
\item "freqency" - number of occurrences in the nodes for given variable.
}

Additionally for plots with single variables:
\itemize{
\item "meanDepth"  - mean depth weighted by gain,
\item "numberOfRoots" - number of occurrences in the root,
\item "weightedRoot" - mean number of occurrences in the root, which is weighted by gain.
}
