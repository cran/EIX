\title{Importance of variables and interactions in the model}
\usage{
importance(xgb_model, data, option = "both")
}
\arguments{
\item{xgb_model}{a xgboost or lightgbm model.}

\item{data}{a data table with data used to train the model.}

\item{option}{if "variables" then table includes only single variables,
if "interactions", then only interactions
if "both", then both single variable and interactons.
Default "both".}
}
\value{
a data table
}
\description{
This functions calculates a table with selected measures of importance
for variables and interactions.
}
\details{
Available measures:
\itemize{
\item "sumGain" - sum of Gain value in all nodes, in which given variable occurs,
\item "sumCover" - sum of Cover value in all nodes, in which given variable occurs; for LightGBM models: number of observation, which pass through the node,
\item "mean5Gain" - mean gain from 5 occurrences of given variable with the highest gain,
\item "meanGain" - mean Gain value in all nodes, in which given variable occurs,
\item "meanCover" - mean Cover value in all nodes, in which given variable occurs; for LightGBM models: mean number of observation, which pass through the node,
\item "freqency" - number of occurrences in the nodes for given variable.
}

Additionally for table with single variables:
\itemize{
\item "meanDepth"  - mean depth weighted by gain,
\item "numberOfRoots" - number of occurrences in the root,
\item "weightedRoot" - mean number of occurrences in the root, which is weighted by gain.
}
